// Convert string to pig latin, maybe I should do this based off of user input?
// user inputs a string and that gets translated to pig latin
// What kind of issues could come from this?
// Would have to either limit to one word at a time somehow, or write a function
// that splits each word apart then translates each to pig latin and puts it back together>
// idk man I hate strings
// words that start with a vowel will have hay added instead of first letter + "ay"
// re reference the utf-8 encoding section.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
